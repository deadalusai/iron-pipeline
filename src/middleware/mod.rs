//! Middleware for use in a `Pipeline`.
//!
//! # A note on `iron::middleware::Handler`
//!
//! All types which implement `iron::middleware::Handler` can also be used as iron-pipeline middleware.
//! However because the `Handler` trait does not understand the concept of "next" middleware,
//! it is generally only useful to put such handlers at the _end_ of a pipeline.
